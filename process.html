               <p>I started my research with the following questions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What is the state of trails and hiking in the United States?</li>
                    <li>What needs would my idea would fill?</li>
                    <li>What equivalent services and apps exist, and does my app provide a unique service that hasn't yet been created?</li>

                <p>I then read a lot of material, ranging in subject matter from trail lingo to trail usage to recent trends to equity and diversity on the trail to trail history to quite a lot else.

                <h3>Questions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>What features and services in an app could help alleviate concerns around trail safety and comfort</li>
                    <li>How can I create an app that doesn't center technology, but instead allows for greater immersion?</li>
                    <li>What is the scope and personality of Wayfind as a whole, and how might its brand reflect this?</li>
                  </ul>
                <p>While working through various possibilities for the app, I spent time puttig together a Wayfind site map and priamary task flows, thinking through all the potential pages and uses for the app that I wanted to include. This helped me make previously vague ideas more concrete, and I was able to start thinking more seriously about the app interface and layout. I simultaneously began brainstorming branding principles and possibilites, including what I envisioned for Wayfind's tone and voice.</p>

                    <img class="arrows" src="img/yellow-line.png" alt="yellow line">
                <p>From the conception of this project, I wanted my own hiking and trail experiences to help inform how I thought about and eventually prototyped this project. More than anything, I wanted to be able to tell a story about why Wayfind mattered, starting from from a personal perspective. This meant reflecting on previous trail experiences, but I also wanted to get on the trail a few times along the development of my project, knowing that certain encounters and experiences that I could only get on the trail would help bring up different app needs and eventualities that I might not think of otherwise.</p>
                <p>I decided to use the Chippewa Moraine State Recreation Area as my 'test subject' for Wayfind. This is an area I've been to many times before, along the Ice Age Trail of Wisconsin. As you'll see in my prototypes, this is the area I chose as my setting to demonstrate different app features. My dad accompanied me there, and we took photos and video footage. We also talked to Rod (pictured below), who shared a variety of fascinating and valuable information. Rod has worked at the David R. Obey Ice Age Interpretive Center for 30 years, and was an incredible wealth of knowledge, both cultural and natural.</p>
                
                <p>When I shared my project idea with Rod, he immediately shared that hikers will often take the wrong turn at a certain intersection in the area – the Ice Age Trail (XX miels in total) and the Circle Loop Trail (4.X miles total), share a trail for a short while. Although clearly marked, hikers will often continue down the Ice Age trail instead of taking the turn for the Circle Loop Trail, and then hike several miles off course before realizing that theyve been hiking longer than they should have to complete the Circle Loop. Rod thought that an app like Wayfind would be hepful in a scenario like this; alerting the hiker when they turned off their desired path. As he said, "If hikers aren't paying attention, it doesn't matter how well marked things are." </p>

                    <h2>Branding</h2>
                    <img class="arrows" src="img/yellow-line.png" alt="yellow line">
                <p>Branding was something I considered from the very beginning, always in the back of my mind even when I wasn't overtly working on it. It felt separate from the actual app capabilities, but simultaneously incredibly important in helping me discern the scope and meaning of Wayfind. I had put together a draft brand book the previous semester in Experimental Interaction, but a lot had changed since then. The app felt and worked differently, with developed ideas and new capabilities. Primarily, the previous Wayfind felt a little too informal, and needed to find a better balance that focused equally on the technological expertise and safety that Wayfind would bring to the hiker. The original branding and style needed to do some catching up. 
                    
                    I want the user to trust the expertise and know that they can depend on the app to have a safe experience, while simultaneously getting a sense of familiarity, calm, joy, and accessibility from the design. On one hand, the brand shouldn’t feel too cold or technical, and on the other, it shouldn’t be cute or woodsy to the point where the brand loses credibility. It needs to fall somewhere in the middle, with clear substance behind the design. Is it currently finding this balance?
                    
                    Namely, I was asking myself:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>How could I update the brand to reflect greater readabilty and accessibility?</li>
                    <li>How might the brand reflect the joy, familiarity and personality of Wayfind as a brand, while equally communicating the credibility and expertise of Wayfind as a service?</li>
                    <li>What visual elements could I develop that would support the brand and serve as useful components in the app prototype?</li>
                  </ul>
                <p>Using a combination of software – Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, and Procreate, I ____.</p>
                <p>Thanks to feedback from several designers along the way, I was able to fine tune and develop the Wayfind brand into something that better matched its purpose, mission, and vision.</p>
