          I have always felt most myself on the trail. I think this is for a few reasons. For one, the vulnerability
          that comes with trusting one’s body, while also trusting the dirt under my feet; the logs and sticks in my
          fire; the ___ - these things make it hard to be anyone but myself. The posturing, __, and ___, of busy,
          everyday life have no choice but to hush when ___. The earth feels present, its heart beating, and I am more
          present as a result. I like myself a little bit more. I feel empowered and capable. I feel courageous. I
          don’t feel these things out of a sense of competition or comparison, but out of a sense of oneness,
          sameness, a relational feeling that hovers around me, talking to me about what really matters. I can
          recognize my solitude while in the same breath feeling a strong sense of relationship and connection to
          others. I can recognize the importance and necessity of that duality.

          <p>Nature, the outdoors, mean a lot of things for a lot of people. No one experience is the same, and often I
            don’t take the time to name or consciously consider these feelings. Mostly I just like the sun on my face,
            the smell of the leaves, the interesting fungi, the off-chance that it might rain, the reminder that I need
            to reapply bug spray. The little, manageable, non-cosmic things. These are important too. So are other
            people’s reasons – learning how to snowshoe, doing research on prairie grasses, an excuse to get away from
            family, a need to work through a problem in your head, a search for inspiration.</p>

          <p>Whatever brings people to the trail, they’re sharing an experience all the same – they are there, and more
            often than not, they choose to be. Whether it’s in search of exercise, joy, alone time, poetry, or soil
            samples, they are seeking some form of experience; an answer, a release, a feeling. </p>

          <p>Wouldn’t it be a beautiful world in which we could all come together in this way?</p>

          <p>It can cost money to get on the trail, it can take transportation to get to the trail, and it can take
            quite a bit of free time to spend on it once you’re there. Racism, Sexism, Ableism, and __ are also large
            presences on the trail. Barriers like these are huge, multifaceted, and go beyond the scope of this project.
            In time though, finding a solution to outdoor access will need to incorporate all of these factors and more.
          </p>
          <p>For now, I’ll talk about two factors which I’ve identified as strong barriers to accessing enjoyable and
            powerful trail experiences, and the factors which Wayfind works to address.</p>

        <div>
          <h3>Safety</h3>
          <p>The idea for Wayfind came to me this past January, when on a hike with my dad in Grand Marais, MN, on the
            shore of Lake Superior. It had recently snowed, and the trail was virtually unmarked beyond the footprints
            of other trail-goers, and tree and brush cover disturbance. For the most part this was fine, but in a few
            open areas it took us some time to find the trial continuity, eventually reaching a spot that took us
            several minutes of exploring and searching to find what we thought was a trail - it wasn’t - and then
            circling back and finding the actual trail. It had gotten dark by the time we were done.</p>

          <p>We were never in any real danger; knowing which direction we had come from, and having Lake Superior as a
            guide, plus it was a relatively short and small hiking area – we could’ve muscled our way through the brush
            and eventually gotten to the highway. We also had some cell signal, being so close to a town. We didn’t
            stress. But, imagine if we couldn’t have found our way as easily? Or if we hadn’t had a cell signal? The
            probability is still pretty high that we would’ve been fine - but the stress, anxiety, and potential fear it
            could’ve caused? Not so easily dismissed.
          </p>

          <p>Not only might naturally occuring issues such as nighttime approaching, or snow, impede one's ability to
            hike safetly, but so might the human-made issue of trail maintenance. At the beginning of 2022, an estimated
            <b>$21.8 billion</b> of repair need existed on roads, buildings, utility systems, and other structures and
            facilities across the National Park System. This figure has doubled since 2018.
          </p>

          <p>Not only that, but according to the not-for-profit National Parks Conservation Association, <b>National
              Park Service staff has shrunk by 14%</b> over the last decade, primarily due to federal funding cuts.
            <b>Total visitation has increased by 20% during the same period.</b> This leads to overwhelmed staff and
            facilities, a record number of rescues, and a trail maintenance deficit that steadily grows.
          </p>

          <blockquote>"Park staff say a lack of preparedness, particularly among newcomers who may underestimate the
            extremes of these wild places, has driven up search and rescue costs and monopolized ranger time."

          <h3>Fear of the Unknown</h3>
          <p>Now, imagine those scenarios/anecdotes above, except you’re a first time hiker with no experience. You
            don’t necessarily know what to look for – Is this a deer trail or a footpath? What does this symbol mean? I
            can’t see the lake anymore, so I don’t know what direction to go and am now all turned around. It’s getting
            dark and I am fearful of what kinds of animals live in this forest. Do bears live here? If I’m guessing at a
            possible outcome, the likelihood of me wanting to repeat an experience like this seems pretty dang low.

            People new to the outdoors, or fearful of the outdoors, need more support. Some of these fears can be solved
            with education and preparation. Some are bigger and more elusive, like the very real fear and history of
            racism in outdoor spaces and industries.

          <blockquote>“If you are new to the world of outdoor life, it can be an intimidating and overwhelming process,”
            said Mrs. Staples. “We don’t want that to deter people from our community from experiencing some of the
            greatest national treasures.”</blockquote>
